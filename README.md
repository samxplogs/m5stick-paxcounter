# m5stick-paxcounter

*Goal is to count nearby Wifi & Bluetooth devices.* 
This project is inspired from [ESP32-Paxcounter](https://github.com/cyberman54/ESP32-Paxcounter)

**What works**
 - [x] count and display number of Bluetooth devices
 - [x] Battery level

**To do**
 - [ ] Implement WiFi counting
This seems to be challenging as space is pretty limited. I don't know if that is fesible in the end.

**Nice to have**


 - [ ] Improve UX using Logo instead of text
